      <p>The API provides information on a particular book which includes the book's title, author, year of publication, and ISBN number, as well as the average rating out of 5 and the total number of reviews that the book has received from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com" style="color: #396791">goodreads</a>.</p>
      <p>In order to access the API, visit this site's URL /api/&lt;isbn&gt;, where &lt;isbn&gt; it is ISBN number of the book that you are requesting information on (be sure to enter the ISBN number without the angle brackets &lt;&gt;).</p>
      <p>The response is a JSON object. For example, sending a GET request to 127.0.0.1:5000/api/0380795272 would return the following:</p>
      <p>
        {<br>
          "author": "Raymond E. Feist", <br>
          "average_score": "3.84", <br>
          "isbn": "0380795272", <br>
